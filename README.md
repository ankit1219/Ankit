Hospital Network Design: In This project, I’d design and implement these network technologies to create a robust and efficient network infrastructure that meets the requirements of my organization or client. This could involve configuring VLANs and PVLANs to segregate traffic, setting up HSRP for redundancy, deploying DHCP for automatic IP address assignment, configuring OSPF for dynamic routing, and ensuring seamless communication between devices using trunk links and port channels. Additionally, you would manage VLAN configuration using VTP and negotiate trunk links between switches using DTP to simplify network administration
